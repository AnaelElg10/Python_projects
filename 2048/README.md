# 2048 Game in Python

This project is a Python implementation of the popular sliding block puzzle game, 2048. The game is built using the Pygame library and offers a graphical interface where players combine tiles with the same numbers to form larger numbers, aiming to create a tile with the number 2048.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your computer. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install Pygame by running `pip install pygame` in your terminal.

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2048.git

Then navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd 2048
```

### How to Play

To start the game, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python game.py
```

Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to slide the tiles on the board. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with their total value. The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.

Up Arrow: Move tiles up
Down Arrow: Move tiles down
Left Arrow: Move tiles left
Right Arrow: Move tiles right
The game ends when the board is filled and no more moves are possible. If you manage to create a tile with the number 2048, you win!

### Features

- Graphical interface using Pygame
- Smooth tile movement and merging animations
- Score tracking based on the value of combined tiles
